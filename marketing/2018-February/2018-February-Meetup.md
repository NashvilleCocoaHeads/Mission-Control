# Easy Data Persistence using Swift Codables

** IMPORTANT: Note that we are meeting at a new location this year! **

This month Blake Merryman shows off how easy it is to use Swift's new data encoding & decoding APIs. Using Swift's Codable, we will easily take data from an external source (like JSON from a webservice) to a type in our app to persisting on disk. We'll also talk about a few gotchas and advanced use-cases.

Blake Merryman is a Senior iOS Developer at Black Pixel. You can find him at blakemerryman.com or just about everywhere @blakemerryman.

6:00 - 6:15 - Pizza & drinks
6:15 - 7:00 - Presentation, Q&A
