We ask a lot of our iPhones these days, and while they're wicked fast, sometimes you just need more speed! Come hear how to use the Instruments app to identify and fix performance bottlenecks in your apps. We'll go over the tooling, dig into some misguided implementations, and cover some best practices for performance tuning.

Jonathan Wiley is the co-founder and lead developer for LunarLincoln, a development shop in Nashville focused on designing and developing mobile apps. Over the past 9 years, Wiley has worked with over 60 clients to ship best-in-class applications for iOS, Android, and macOS. When he's not building apps, Wiley can be found playing with his new kitten (Freddie Mercury) and obsessing over space exploration. You can follow Wiley (@JonathanWiley) and LunarLincoln (@LunarLincoln) on Twitter.

Meeting Schedule:
6:00 - 6:15 - Pizza & drinks
6:15 - 7:00 - Presentation, Q&A
7:00 - 8:00 - Socializing
