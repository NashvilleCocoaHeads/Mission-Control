# Introduction to iOS Testing
** IMPORTANT: Note that we are meeting at a new location this year! **

We all try to write reliable apps, but how do you make sure the code you write behaves exactly the way it should? This month, Addison Webb will cover the basics of Unit and UI testing in Xcode. By the end of the night you should have a better understanding of testing and why it is valuable for creating robust and reliable apps.

Addison Webb is an iOS Developer in Franklin, TN. You can follow Addison at [addisonwebb.com](http://addisonwebb.com) and Twitter [@addisonwebb](https://twitter.com/addisonwebb).

6:15 - 7:00 - Presentation, Q&A
