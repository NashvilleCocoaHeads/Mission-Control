# Building a Custom Data Structure in Swift

** IMPORTANT: Note that we are meeting at a new location this year! **

Learn about Swift data structures as we build our own from scratch! We’ll explore language features such as associated types and protocol extensions that will help us along the way. We’ll also touch on building and testing the project on Linux. By the end, we’ll have created a new data structure you may find useful in any of your Swift projects.

Patrick Goley is an independent software developer who’s been building mobile apps for five years. He loves writing Swift and contributing to open source. He’s also happy to help you with any questions or problems you may have! You can find him on Twitter [@bitsbetweenbits](https://twitter.com/bitsbetweenbits).
